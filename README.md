# DNA-RNA-Polypeptide Tool (DRAFT)

A tool that encodes input words into DNA sequences and translates them into RNA and polypeptide chains using amino acid one-letter codes. Includes a graphical user interface (GUI) built with Qt6 for visualizing the sequences and highlighting embedded words.

## Features

- 🧬 Converts text into DNA, RNA, and amino acid sequences
- 🎨 Graphical user interface using Qt6 (resizable layout)
- 🌈 Visualization of embedded words and peptide chains with color
- 🖥️ Will be build for both Windows and Linux using Nuitka 
- 📦 Easy installation and use
